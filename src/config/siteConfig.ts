  faq: [
    {
      question: "What is health and wellness coaching?",
      answer:
        "Health and wellness coaching is a personalized approach to helping you achieve your health goals. Rather than treating symptoms in isolation, I look at the whole picture — nutrition, lifestyle, stress, sleep, and more — to identify the root causes of your health challenges and create a sustainable plan for improvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from seeing my doctor?",
      answer:
        "Your doctor manages diagnoses and prescribes treatment — that's essential work. Health coaching focuses on the lifestyle factors that standard medicine often doesn't have time to address: diet quality, stress management, sleep habits, gut health, and behavioral change. I work alongside your medical team, not instead of it.",
    },
    {
      question: "What can I expect from the discovery call?",
      answer:
        "The free discovery call is a genuine 30-minute conversation — no sales pressure, no hidden agenda. We'll talk about your health concerns, your goals, and whether working together is the right fit. If it's not, you'll still leave with clarity and useful perspective on your situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long before I see results?",
      answer:
        "Every person is different, but most clients notice meaningful improvements within the first 4-6 weeks. Some changes — like increased energy and better sleep — can happen quickly, while others — like hormonal balance or gut healing — take more time. We track your progress together and adjust as needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to live nearby?",
      answer:
        "No — all coaching sessions are conducted via video call, so we can work together regardless of where you live.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I've already tried everything?",
      answer:
        "Many of my clients come to me after years of searching for answers. The difference with personalized coaching is that we look at the whole system — not just individual symptoms. By connecting the dots between your nutrition, stress, sleep, gut health, and lifestyle, we often find patterns and root causes that were missed before.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the discovery call really free?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. It's a genuine conversation about your health — no pressure, no obligation. If we're a good fit, we'll discuss next steps. If not, no hard feelings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do sessions work?",
      answer:
        "Sessions are conducted via video call at a time that works for your schedule. Between sessions, you'll have messaging support so you can ask questions and stay on track. Every session builds on the last, so your plan evolves as you progress.",
